  },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

### Frontend UI Components/Pages

#### Components Used
- **ComponentName** (`components/ComponentName.tsx`)
  - Purpose: What it does
  - Props: Key properties and their types
  - Usage: Where it's used

#### Pages Involved
- **PageName** (`pages/PageName.tsx`)
  - Route: `/route-path`
  - Purpose: What the page accomplishes
  - Components: Which components it uses

#### UI Flow
1. User starts at [specific page/component]
2. User performs [action]
3. System responds with [behavior]
4. User sees [result]

### Database Tables Involved

#### Primary Tables
```sql
-- Main table for this feature
CREATE TABLE feature_table (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Related Tables
- **table_name**: How it relates to the feature
- **another_table**: Its role in the feature

#### Key Relationships
```sql
-- Foreign key relationships
ALTER TABLE feature_table 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user_id 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id);
```

### Feature Flag (if any)

#### Flag Definition
```typescript
FEATURE_NAME: {
  name: 'FEATURE_NAME',
  enabled: false,
  environments: ['development'],
  description: 'Enable [feature description]',
  rolloutPercentage: 0
}
```

#### Usage in Code
```typescript
// Frontend usage
if (isEnabled('FEATURE_NAME')) {
  // Show new feature
} else {
  // Show fallback or nothing
}

// Backend usage
if is_feature_enabled("FEATURE_NAME"):
    # Execute feature code
    pass
```

#### Rollout Plan
1. **Development**: Enable for testing
2. **Staging**: Full testing with QA team
3. **Production Pilot**: 5% of users
4. **Gradual Rollout**: 25% → 50% ��� 100%
5. **Flag Removal**: After 2 weeks stable
